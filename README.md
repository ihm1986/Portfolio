# Hi, I'm Ivan Miwa 👋

A highly analytical and self-motivated professional with a B.S. in Computer Science, now making a deliberate career transition into the world of data.

### A bit about me...

For 14 years, I was a self-employed professional poker player. While unconventional, this career was, at its core, functionally the role of a **quantitative analyst**. My success depended entirely on my ability to:

-   🧠 Analyze massive datasets in real-time to find patterns and an edge.
-   📊 Manage risk and a dynamic financial budget with extreme discipline.
-   💡 Solve complex, ambiguous problems with a logical, data-driven approach.

I have now formalized this deep, practical experience by completing the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, and I'm excited to apply my unique skill set to solve business problems. I thrive in environments that value independent thinking, ownership, and a relentless focus on results.

### 📊 Featured Project

For now, this section highlights my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. I will be adding more projects here as I build them.

**[Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study](./Cyclistic)** 

-   **Business Problem:** How can a bike-share company convert more casual riders into paying annual members?
-   **My Task:** I analyzed a 6 months worth of trip data to identify key behavioral differences between the two user groups.
-   **Tools Used:** SQL for data cleaning and aggregation, and Excel for visualization.
-   **Outcome:** The analysis revealed that casual riders primarily use the service for leisure on weekends, while members use it for shorter, daily commutes. I delivered a final recommendation for a targeted marketing campaign to highlight the value of a membership for daily use, providing the business with a clear, data-driven strategy to increase conversions.
